/**
 * @file reconciliation-cause-hint.ts
 * @description Desktop-main (ESM) heuristic that explains WHY a day×model's local
 * genai-prices estimate drifted from what the vendor actually billed (FEA-1436).
 * Pure function, no I/O — it takes already-computed drift features and returns a
 * ranked list of plausible human-readable causes for the Diagnostics "explain"
 * expander.
 *
 * ── This is a hint, not a verdict ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Drift is INFORMATIONAL. We never re-price old sessions or "correct" the local
 * estimate from these hints (explicit non-goal). The point is to tell the user
 * the most likely benign explanation first so a small expected drift doesn't read
 * as a billing bug.
 *
 * ── The permanent, expected gap ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `cache_write_1h_unmodeled` is a KNOWN, permanent under-estimate, not a
 * transient anomaly: genai-prices does not model Anthropic's 1-hour cache-write
 * pricing tier, so any day that wrote 1h cache entries will show local < vendor.
 * Its hint links to the upstream genai-prices project (the package's declared
 * homepage) rather than a fabricated issue number, and is flagged `permanent` so
 * the UI can label it "expected" instead of actionable.
